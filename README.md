A set of quick and dirty data management scripts, for when the Mealie UI doesn't cut it.

# Working

- Show me all recipes with unparsed ingredients
- Show me all recipes without tools listed

# TODO

- Show me all recipes without categories
- Automatically mark a recipe that includes the word 'oven' as requiring the tool 'Oven'
- As above, dinner => Dinner; lunch => Lunch; breakfast => Breakfast
- Merge two foods adding one as aliases of the other
- Add a wikidata ID to each ingredient
- Add all wikidata aliases as aliases
